// This file is intentionally left mostly empty as the implementation is now in the header file.
// The template-based implementation is defined in node.hpp.

// If you need to add any non-template functions or implementations that can't be in the header,
// you can add them here.

// Example of a non-template helper function that might be needed:
void initializeNode() {
    // Any global initialization code for nodes
}
